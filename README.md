# Official OpenController Repo
OpenController is an open-source, arduino-based controller. 
You can replicate this project, but I would recommend 3D printing and Python knowledge, as I will not be holding your hand.
The entire casing can be 3D printed, and all relevant 
It uses python to read the arduinos serial output and simulate key presses based on that.
