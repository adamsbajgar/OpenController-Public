# Official OpenController Repo
OpenController is an open-source, arduino-based controller. I created it as a practice project for electronics and Python.
You can replicate this project, but I would recommend 3D printing and Python knowledge, as I will not be holding your hand beyond the basics, even though everything is very self-explanatory.

### The Code
The entire casing can be 3D printed, all models are stored in the provided blender file.
It uses python to read the arduinos serial output and simulate key presses based on that.
